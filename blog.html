        A deep passion for photography is essential for success as a professional photographer. Without it, you risk being stuck in a 
        difficult profession that you don't enjoy, feeling resentful and envious of others with better-paying jobs. But, equally important is 
        the art of clearly communicating your passion to your prospects. Why DO you do what you do?<br><br>
        A quick question for you. Do you have a passion for photography that drives you to push yourself as a professional photographer every 
        single day, regardless of the obstacles and challenges that get in your way?<br><br>
        The concepts of “passion”, “drive” and “determination” are deeply fascinating to me, and central to my work as a marketing coach as 
        I strive to help photographers gain more clarity in their businesses. So, whenever I get the chance, one of the first questions I ask a 
        professional photographer who might be struggling is almost always:<br><br>
        "Why do you do it? I mean, why do you get up every day and put yourself through the wringer, trying to make your photography 
        business conform to your vision of success?"<br><br>
        Of course, I hear a lot of different answers, but the most common one I get is something like this:<br><br>
        “I have a passion for photography! I really love a life of being creative…”<br><br>
        Fair enough, but (as I’ve said so many times before on this blog), it’s just not enough.
        Often, the photographer’s tone of voice belies what they’re really saying, as if the stress , worry and doubts they’re feeling on the inside are 
        etched into the very inflection of their words, robbing their response of any real passion. But, more importantly, claiming to have a passion for 
        photography is only to be expected for any photographer. It’s a given, without which there would be no photographer.<br><br>
        After all, who would knowingly hire a photographer who did not have at least some enthusiasm for what they do? No one, right?
        If challenged about this, the same photographers get rather defensive (understandably) and say things like, “but I REALLY DO have passion for it! 
        I love it, and can’t imagine doing anything else…”<br><br>
        “Why?” I ask… And then the words so often dry up, and it becomes eerily quiet… Okay, I know that not everyone can express such things in words at the 
        drop of a hat, or when they’re put on the spot like that, but surely there has to be something more at the center of their being that will accept 
        no other pursuit than photography as a way to show the world who they are.
